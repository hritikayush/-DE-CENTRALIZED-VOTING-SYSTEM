# -DE-CENTRALIZED-VOTING-SYSTEM

Its a new age Decentralized Voting System which helps to have a transparent, manipulation-free Voting process for any ongoing events/elections.
Any Blockchain n/w user who is using this application would be knowing every detail about each and every contestant having their candidature in election process.
The manager of the event/election who only has a power of closing the voting poll cannot in any way or the other, manipulate the votes earned by a candidate.
Anyone in this network can organize an event in a college environment and one can push his/her teams into the event for taking part in the event/election.
Its a prototype, so all the transaction the Ethereum/Blockchain network is taking place with the help of test-ethers and not real-ethers.
So, the sole purpose of this voting system which is to make voting process transparent, tamper-free and unmanipulated is using Blockchain as its core-technology 
to de-centralize the voting system process, so that every node in the Blockchain has the idea/knowledge of all the happenings and data in the network.

Some of the tools and technologies used for developing this prototype :
1.Solidity Language for buildind the Smart Contracts (Backend)
2.ReactJS Framework for building the User Interface of the System (Frontend)
3.Tailwind CSS for designing the Interfeace(Frontend)
4.Mocha test framework for testing the smart contracts 
5.Truffle for building and deploying this Blockchain web-app
6.Metamask Wallet for each and every transactions taking place in the Ethereum Network
7.Ethereum Network where all the data and transactions ae being stored
